#### ✅ PR Ready for Creation
**GitHub PR Link:** https://github.com/MarkGerber1/skin-advisor/pull/new/feature/smoke-preview-test

**Preview Workflow:** ✅ Configured
- File: `.github/workflows/preview-deploy.yml`
- Triggers: PR to master
- Actions: Deploy preview + comment with URL + cleanup on merge/close

### 4. Railway Configuration

#### ✅ Railway Settings (Expected)
```json
// railway.json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "python -m bot.main",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE"
  }
}
```

#### ⚠️ Railway Dashboard Manual Check Required
- **Branch:** Should be `master`
- **Auto Deploy:** Should be `ON`
- **Preview Environments:** Should be `ON`

### 5. Required Manual Actions

#### 🚨 CRITICAL: Change Default Branch
```
GitHub.com → Settings → Branches
▼ Default branch: main → master
✅ Save changes
```

#### 🚨 CRITICAL: Add Branch Protection
```
Settings → Branches → Add rule
Branch name pattern: master

✅ Require a pull request before merging
✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Status checks: CI
✅ Require linear history
✅ Include administrators
✅ Create rule
```

#### 🚨 CRITICAL: Verify Railway Token
```
GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
- Name: RAILWAY_TOKEN
- Status: ✅ Should exist
```

## 🎯 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### After Manual Configuration:
- [ ] Default branch changed to `master`
- [ ] Branch protection rule added for `master`
- [ ] RAILWAY_TOKEN secret exists
- [ ] Railway branch set to `master`
- [ ] Railway auto deploy = ON
- [ ] Railway preview environments = ON

### Expected Behavior:
- [ ] Push to master → CI → Production Deploy
- [ ] PR to master → Preview Deploy (with URL comment)
- [ ] Merge/close PR → Preview cleanup
- [ ] Direct push to master blocked by protection

## 📈 NEXT STEPS

1. **IMMEDIATELY:** Change default branch to `master` in GitHub
2. **IMMEDIATELY:** Add branch protection rule for `master`
3. **VERIFY:** RAILWAY_TOKEN secret exists
4. **VERIFY:** Railway settings match requirements
5. **TEST:** Create PR from feature branch to trigger preview
6. **MONITOR:** CI/CD pipeline execution
